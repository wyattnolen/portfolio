				Back in 2012, I took my first steps into web development at a small
				agency called Zavoodi, and I've been hooked ever since. Starting with
				custom Tumblr themes, I quickly discovered a passion for front-end
				development and have spent the last decade honing my skills. Along the
				way, I've had the opportunity to work at an advertising agency, a
				start-up, a large corporation, and a digital product studio. Each
				experience has deepened my commitment to creating high-quality web
				experiences, from large-scale applications to finely crafted components.

				Today, my work centers on building high-performance websites with a
				strong emphasis on accessibility and visual appeal. I'm passionate about
				designing and coding at the intersection of aesthetics and
				functionality, ensuring that each user interface I create is intuitive,
				responsive, and accessible to everyone. I'm always exploring ways to
				bring creativity to my projects, from crafting seamless user experiences
				to enhancing the finer details that make an interface feel polished and
				complete.

				When I'm not coding, I'm usually busy raising my daughter, Clark, and
				finding balance in activities I love. You can often find me in the
				garden, experimenting with composting, or unwinding with my wife while
				we play Baldur's Gate 3. I'm always drawn to projects that let me
				combine creativity with technical skill, and I love bringing that energy
				into my work and personal life alike.
