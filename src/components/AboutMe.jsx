				Back in 2007, I took my first steps into web development when I tried my hand at developing MySpace themes, which sparked my passion for front-end development. Since then, I've gained experience across diverse environments, from a <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://zavoodi.com/">start-up</a>, a web consulting studio, a newspaper, to several mid-market e-commerce companies in industries such as <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.doversaddlery.com/">horse lifestyle</a>, <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.halegroves.com/">food & gifts</a>, <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.vandykes.com/">furniture</a>, <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.agrisupply.com/">tractor supply</a>, <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://pureromance.com/">health & beauty</a>, and <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.blackwidowpro.com/">hardware</a>.

				These days, my focus is threefold: building accessible user interfaces,
				optimizing website performance, and transforming designs to be modern
				and engaging. But sometimes I just want to want to <a className="text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/wyattnolen/pen/zYPWrdg">build fun things</a>.

            When I'm not coding, I'm usually wrapped up in the joy of raising my daughter, Clark, and savoring moments that bring balance to life. You'll often find me in the garden, exploring composting experiments, or unwinding with my wife as we adventure together in Baldur's Gate 3.
